# Expanding Card Set

This expanding card set is based on a 50 projects in 50 days course I am doing by Brad Traversy. 

A new course that came out in 2020 that is designed to help you expand your knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In the first lesson I added a slight twist by including a small touch of Sass, and CATS!!
